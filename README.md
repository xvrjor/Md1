Root directory containing my Project for the 1st Module

I have 5 folders with each one containing a readme.md answering the questions below:

1. Who am I?
2. Where I'm going?
3. What do I know?
4. What's possible?
5. What's important to me?

The main goal of this 1st module is to display I'm able to go through the terminal and understand how to create, edit, delete and publish files using it.
