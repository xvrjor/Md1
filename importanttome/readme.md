What is important to me in is my health, family, and growth. I want to be in the greatest health I can because it'll allow me to do more in 
life. If my family is in a happy state this will make me happy as well. Finally the reason growth is so important to me is I want to grow as 
person allows me to evolve and do stuff I wasn't able to do years, months and even days ago.
